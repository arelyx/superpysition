### Python should mean snake!!

```bash
$ file python 
python: POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
$ ./python --version
Python 3.10.2
$ file python 
python: symbolic link to /usr/bin/python3
```

If `python2` and `python3` is installed, but `python` does not exist the script will delete itself and alias to one or the other.
